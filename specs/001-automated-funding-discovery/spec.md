# Feature Specification: Automated Funding Discovery Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `001-automated-funding-discovery`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an automated funding discovery workflow where the system generates AI-powered search queries, executes web crawling through multiple search engines (Searxng, Tavily, Perplexity), identifies candidate funding sources, performs initial data extraction and confidence scoring, stores candidates in a PostgreSQL database with pending validation status, and presents them to admin users in a review queue where they can use AI-assisted tools to enhance the scraped data, manually add contact intelligence and missing details, and approve sources for inclusion in the searchable knowledge base"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ‚úì
   ‚Üí Feature description provided and comprehensive
2. Extract key concepts from description ‚úì
   ‚Üí Actors: admin users, AI systems
   ‚Üí Actions: discover, extract, score, review, enhance, approve
   ‚Üí Data: funding sources, candidates, contact intelligence
   ‚Üí Constraints: multiple search engines, confidence scoring, human validation
3. For each unclear aspect: ‚úì
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly specified in user input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
   ‚Üí Clear admin workflow from discovery to approval
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì
   ‚Üí Funding Source Candidates, Admin Users, Contact Intelligence
7. Run Review Checklist ‚úì
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
   ‚Üí Focused on business value and admin needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Admin users (Kevin and Huw) need to efficiently discover, validate, and approve funding sources for the NorthStar knowledge base. The system automatically discovers potential funding sources from the web, presents them in a manageable review queue, and provides AI-assisted tools to help admins gather comprehensive information including critical contact intelligence before approving sources for client access.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system has executed automated discovery, **When** an admin user logs in, **Then** they see a prioritized queue of candidate funding sources with initial confidence scores and extracted data
2. **Given** an admin is reviewing a funding source candidate, **When** they use AI-assisted enhancement tools, **Then** the system helps them gather additional details from the original website including contact information and organizational details
3. **Given** an admin has enhanced a candidate with complete information, **When** they approve the source, **Then** it moves from candidate status to the searchable knowledge base available for client queries
4. **Given** multiple search engines have discovered the same funding source, **When** the system processes candidates, **Then** it deduplicates and merges information to present a single enhanced candidate
5. **Given** a funding source has poor confidence scores or missing critical information, **When** an admin reviews it, **Then** they can reject it from the queue to focus on higher-value candidates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when AI discovery finds thousands of candidates in one day? (Queue management and prioritization)
- How does system handle funding sources with expired deadlines or outdated information? (Lifecycle management)
- What occurs when contact intelligence extraction fails or returns invalid data? (Manual override and validation)
- How does system behave when the same funding source appears across multiple discovery cycles? (Duplicate detection and update workflows)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically execute funding discovery searches across multiple search engines on a scheduled basis
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract and score candidate funding sources with confidence ratings based on data completeness and relevance  
- **FR-003**: System MUST store discovered candidates in pending validation status separate from approved funding sources
- **FR-004**: System MUST present candidates to admin users in a prioritized review queue interface
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide AI-assisted tools within the review interface to enhance candidate data from source websites
- **FR-006**: Admin users MUST be able to manually add or edit funding source information including contact intelligence
- **FR-007**: Admin users MUST be able to approve candidates to move them into the searchable knowledge base
- **FR-008**: Admin users MUST be able to reject candidates to remove them from the review queue
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect and handle duplicate funding sources discovered across multiple search cycles
- **FR-010**: System MUST track the discovery source and method for each candidate for audit and improvement purposes
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve the original discovered data alongside admin enhancements for quality tracking
- **FR-012**: System MUST support bulk actions for admin efficiency when processing multiple similar candidates

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Funding Source Candidate**: Discovered potential funding opportunity with confidence score, discovery metadata, extracted information, validation status, and enhancement history
- **Admin User**: System administrator with permissions to review, enhance, approve, or reject funding source candidates
- **Discovery Session**: Automated search execution record including search engines used, queries generated, results found, and processing status
- **Contact Intelligence**: Person or organizational contact information including names, roles, email addresses, phone numbers, and relationship context
- **Enhancement Record**: Log of manual improvements made by admin users including what was added, when, and by whom for quality tracking
