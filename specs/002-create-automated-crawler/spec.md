# Feature Specification: Automated Crawler Infrastructure - Phase 1 Metadata Judging

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-automated-crawler`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create automated crawler infrastructure for Phase 1 metadata judging: system generates AI-powered search queries to discover funding sources across multiple search engines (Searxng, Tavily, Browserbase, Perplexity), performs domain-level deduplication to prevent reprocessing same domains, judges candidates based on search engine metadata only (no web crawling) using confidence scoring with funding keywords, domain credibility, geographic relevance, and organization type detection, registers domains with blacklist management and quality tracking, creates high-confidence candidates (>= 0.6) as PENDING_CRAWL status for Phase 2 deep crawling, skips low-confidence results to save processing resources, tracks domain quality metrics for continuous improvement, and uses Java 25 Virtual Threads for parallel processing of 20-25 search results per query with simple orchestrator pattern (no Kafka, no Spring Integration)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input 
   ’ Feature description comprehensive and detailed
2. Extract key concepts from description 
   ’ Actors: System (automated discovery), admin users (blacklist management)
   ’ Actions: generate queries, search, deduplicate, judge, score, create candidates, skip, track
   ’ Data: domains, search results, candidates, quality scores, blacklists
   ’ Constraints: metadata-only judging (no web crawling), confidence threshold 0.6, multiple search engines
3. For each unclear aspect: 
   ’ Query generation strategy specified as AI-powered
   ’ Confidence threshold clearly defined (0.6)
   ’ Search engines enumerated (Searxng, Tavily, Browserbase, Perplexity)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section 
   ’ Automated discovery workflow clear
   ’ Quality-based filtering workflow defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements 
   ’ Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities 
   ’ Domains, SearchResults, Candidates, QualityMetrics
7. Run Review Checklist 
   ’ No implementation details in business spec
   ’ Focused on discovery automation and quality management
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
The system needs to automatically discover potential funding sources across the web without human intervention, intelligently filter out low-quality or irrelevant results before expensive web crawling operations, and prevent wasting resources on domains that have already been evaluated or are known to be problematic. This enables efficient scaling of the funding discovery workflow while maintaining quality control through automated scoring and deduplication.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system has generated search queries for funding opportunities, **When** it executes searches across multiple search engines, **Then** it receives 20-25 search results per query with metadata including title, description, and URL
2. **Given** a search result with URL from domain "foundation-example.org", **When** the system has already processed this domain, **Then** it skips the result without further processing to avoid duplicate work
3. **Given** a search result with funding-related keywords, credible domain, and geographic relevance to Eastern Europe, **When** the system judges the metadata quality, **Then** it assigns a confidence score of 0.6 or higher and creates a candidate for detailed evaluation
4. **Given** a search result with low confidence score (below 0.6), **When** the system completes judging, **Then** it skips creating a candidate and records the domain as low-quality to avoid future processing
5. **Given** an admin user identifies a domain as spam or scam, **When** they blacklist the domain, **Then** all future search results from that domain are automatically rejected regardless of content
6. **Given** multiple search results from the same domain over time, **When** the system tracks quality metrics, **Then** it learns which domains consistently yield high-quality funding sources versus which produce low-quality results

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all search engines return the same funding source? (Deduplication must recognize same domain across multiple URLs)
- How does the system handle a previously high-quality domain that stops offering funding? (Quality tracking must degrade domain scores over time)
- What occurs when a legitimate funding organization shares a domain with spam content? (Blacklist management must be reversible)
- How does the system behave when search engines return no results or error? (Graceful handling without blocking the discovery workflow)
- What happens when confidence scoring produces many results exactly at the 0.6 threshold? (Clear boundary rules needed)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically generate search queries targeting funding sources relevant to Eastern European geography
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute searches across multiple configured search engines to maximize discovery coverage
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract domain name from each search result URL for deduplication tracking
- **FR-004**: System MUST skip processing search results from domains already evaluated or blacklisted
- **FR-005**: System MUST register newly discovered domains with discovery timestamp and session tracking
- **FR-006**: System MUST judge search result quality based solely on metadata (title, description, URL) without accessing the actual webpage
- **FR-007**: System MUST calculate confidence scores using multiple weighted criteria: funding keywords, domain credibility, geographic relevance, and organization type indicators
- **FR-008**: System MUST create candidates with "pending crawl" status when confidence score meets or exceeds 0.6 threshold
- **FR-009**: System MUST skip creating candidates when confidence score falls below 0.6 threshold to conserve processing resources
- **FR-010**: System MUST track domain quality metrics including best confidence score, high-quality candidate count, and low-quality candidate count
- **FR-011**: System MUST support admin users blacklisting domains with documented reasons
- **FR-012**: System MUST permanently prevent processing of blacklisted domains across all future discovery sessions
- **FR-013**: System MUST support marking domains as "no funds this year" to allow re-evaluation in future years
- **FR-014**: System MUST process search results in parallel to minimize discovery session duration
- **FR-015**: System MUST record processing statistics including total processed, candidates created, skipped counts, and average confidence scores
- **FR-016**: System MUST associate each created candidate with its originating domain for quality tracking
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle processing failures gracefully with exponential backoff retry logic for transient errors
- **FR-018**: System MUST distinguish between temporary processing failures and permanent blacklist status

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Domain**: Represents a unique website domain discovered through search results; tracks processing history, quality metrics (best confidence, candidate counts), blacklist status and reason, "no funds this year" marking, processing failure count, and retry scheduling
- **Search Result**: Metadata from search engine including URL, title, description, search engine name, original query, and result position; used for quality judging without accessing actual webpage
- **Metadata Judgment**: Quality assessment of a search result including overall confidence score, individual judge scores (funding keywords, domain credibility, geographic relevance, organization type), reasoning explanation, and extracted organization/program names
- **Processing Statistics**: Aggregated metrics from discovery session including total results processed, candidates created, skipped counts by reason (low confidence, domain already processed, blacklisted), average/min/max confidence scores, and processing duration
- **Blacklist Entry**: Record of admin decision to permanently block a domain including blacklisting admin user, timestamp, human-provided reason, and optional notes for future reference
