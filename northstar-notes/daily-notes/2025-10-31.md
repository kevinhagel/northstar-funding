## 💡 Key Insights

### The Real-World Context
Understanding that this project was inspired by The NorthStar Foundation Bulgaria school proposal completely changes the perspective. Key statistics:
- 30% of Bulgarians at risk of poverty (vs 21.4% EU average)
- 21% in Burgas region below poverty line
- 26% of children aged 0-17 at risk of poverty
- School needs funding for land, buildings, programs, scholarships

This isn't just a technical project - it's solving a real problem for real children.

### Documentation Patterns
Established clear patterns for:
- Session summaries (preserve context across sessions)
- Architecture Decision Records (capture "why" behind decisions)
- Wiki linking (create knowledge graph)
- Code references (file:line format)
- Tag taxonomy (multi-dimensional organization)

## 📝 Notes

### Morning Session (User request)
- User requested adding personal context (American expat in Burgas, Bulgaria)
- User will be on bicycle ride for ~1 hour
- Full permissions to create documentation and Obsidian vault structure

### Documentation Session (~2 hours)
**Research Phase**:
