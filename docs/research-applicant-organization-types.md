# Applicant Organization Types - Research Document
## Taxonomy of Organizations That SEEK Funding

**Version**: 0.1
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Research Phase

---

## Purpose

We need to classify **organizations that seek/receive funding** (applicants/recipients) into a comprehensive taxonomy. This is distinct from our **Funder Organization Taxonomy** (who provides funding).

**Key Use**:
- Funding sources specify eligibility: "NGOs and educational institutions can apply"
- Users search: "Show me grants for schools in Bulgaria"
- System matches: Funding eligibility requirements → Applicant types

**Critical Reality**: Organizations are complex, not simple single types.

---

## Real-World Complexity: British Centre Example

**British Centre, Burgas, Bulgaria**:

```
British Centre (Legal Entity 1)
├─ Type: Private Educational Institution
├─ Legal Structure: For-profit company
├─ Activities: K-12 education, English language instruction
└─ Cannot apply to grants requiring "registered non-profit"

NorthStar Foundation (Legal Entity 2)
├─ Type: Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)
├─ Legal Structure: Registered Bulgarian non-profit
├─ Activities: Support for vulnerable children and youth
└─ CAN apply to grants requiring "registered non-profit"

Relationship:
├─ Common ownership/governance
├─ Shared mission (education for vulnerable youth)
└─ Can apply JOINTLY or SEPARATELY depending on funder requirements
```

**Funding Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: NGO-only grant**
- Funder requirement: "Registered non-profit organizations"
- **NorthStar Foundation applies** (eligible)
- **British Centre does NOT apply** (ineligible - for-profit)

**Scenario 2: Educational institution grant**
- Funder requirement: "K-12 schools and educational institutions"
- **British Centre applies** (eligible)
- **NorthStar Foundation may not apply** (not a school)

**Scenario 3: Partnership required**
- Funder requirement: "NGO partnered with educational institution"
- **NorthStar Foundation + British Centre apply together** (both eligible)

**Scenario 4: Either/or eligibility**
- Funder requirement: "NGOs OR educational institutions"
- **Either can apply** (both eligible separately)

---

## Key Insight: Applicant Types ≠ Legal Structures

Organizations have multiple dimensions:

### 1. **Organization Type** (activity-based)
- What they DO: Education, Healthcare, Community Development

### 2. **Legal Structure** (registration-based)
- How they're legally registered: Non-profit, For-profit, Public institution

### 3. **Sector** (domain-based)
- Where they operate: Education, Health, Environment, Arts

### 4. **Beneficiary Focus** (who they serve)
- Who they help: Children, Elderly, Refugees, Students

Example: **British Centre**
- Type: Educational Institution
- Legal: For-profit company
- Sector: Education (K-12)
- Beneficiaries: Students (ages 3-18)

Example: **NorthStar Foundation**
- Type: Non-Governmental Organization
- Legal: Registered non-profit
- Sector: Education, Social Services, Youth Development
- Beneficiaries: Vulnerable children and youth

    private ApplicantCategory category; // EDUCATIONAL, NGO, GOVERNMENT, etc.

    // Description
    private String description;

    private String typicalEligibilityNotes;
    // "Usually eligible for education grants; may not be eligible for grants requiring non-profit status if for-profit"

    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt;
}

public enum ApplicantCategory {
    EDUCATIONAL,
    NGO,
    GOVERNMENT_PUBLIC,
    RELIGIOUS,
    HEALTHCARE,
    CULTURAL_ARTS,
    SOCIAL_ENTERPRISE,
    BUSINESS,

    INDIVIDUAL
}
```

### FundingSource Eligibility

```java
@Table("funding_source")
public class FundingSource {
    // ... existing fields ...

    // Applicant eligibility
    // Stored as many-to-many relationship
}

@Table("funding_source_applicant_eligibility")
public class FundingSourceApplicantEligibility {

    @Id
    private UUID id;

    private UUID fundingSourceId; // FK

    private UUID applicantTypeId; // FK to ApplicantOrganizationType

    private EligibilityRule rule; // REQUIRED, ALLOWED, PREFERRED, EXCLUDED

    private Set<LegalStructure> requiredLegalStructures;
    // Example: "NGO" applicant type BUT must be REGISTERED_CHARITY legal structure

    private String additionalRequirements;
    // "Must be registered for at least 2 years"
    // "Must have annual budget under €1M"

    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
}

public enum EligibilityRule {
    REQUIRED,   // Must be this type to apply
    ALLOWED,    // Can be this type (among others)
    PREFERRED,  // Preference given to this type
    EXCLUDED    // Explicitly not allowed
}
```

### Example: Complex Eligibility

**Example 1: NGO-only grant**
```

Eligibility Records:
1. Applicant Type: "Registered Charity/NGO"
   Rule: REQUIRED
   Legal Structures: [REGISTERED_CHARITY, NON_PROFIT_ASSOCIATION]
   Additional: "Must be registered for at least 1 year"

Result:
✓ NorthStar Foundation (NGO, registered charity) - ELIGIBLE
✗ British Centre (School, for-profit LLC) - INELIGIBLE
```

**Example 2: Educational institutions OR NGOs**
```
Funding Source: "Education Infrastructure Grant"

✓ NorthStar Foundation (NGO) + British Centre (School) partnership - ELIGIBLE
✗ NorthStar Foundation alone - INELIGIBLE (partnership required)
✗ British Centre alone - INELIGIBLE (partnership required)
```

## Complex Organization Modeling

For organizations like British Centre + NorthStar:

### Option 1: Separate Entities (Recommended)

```java
// Two separate organizations
Organization britishCentre = Organization.builder()
    .name("British Centre, Burgas")
    .applicantType("K-12 School")
    .legalStructure(LegalStructure.FOR_PROFIT_LLC)
    .build();

Organization northstarFoundation = Organization.builder()
    .name("NorthStar Foundation")
    .applicantType("Registered Charity/NGO")
    .legalStructure(LegalStructure.REGISTERED_CHARITY)
    .build();

// Link them
OrganizationRelationship relationship = OrganizationRelationship.builder()
    .organizationId(britishCentre.getId())
    .relatedOrganizationId(northstarFoundation.getId())
    .relationshipType(RelationshipType.AFFILIATED)
    .description("NorthStar Foundation supports British Centre's mission")
    .build();
```

### Option 2: Multi-Type Organizations

```java
// One organization with multiple types/roles
Organization britishCentreGroup = Organization.builder()
    .name("British Centre & NorthStar Foundation")
    .applicantTypes([
        "K-12 School",         // Via British Centre
        "Registered Charity/NGO" // Via NorthStar Foundation
    ])
    .legalStructures([
        LegalStructure.FOR_PROFIT_LLC,      // British Centre
        LegalStructure.REGISTERED_CHARITY    // NorthStar Foundation
    ])
    .hasMultipleLegalEntities(true)
    .build();
```

**Recommendation**: Use Option 1 (separate entities with relationships) for clarity and accuracy.

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Survey Funding Source Eligibility Requirements
- [ ] Review 20-30 real funding sources
- [ ] Document their applicant eligibility requirements
- [ ] Identify common patterns

**Suggested List**:
1. America for Bulgaria Foundation grants
2. EU Erasmus+ program
3. EU Horizons Europe research grants
4. USAID civil society grants
5. Open Society Foundations
6. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (education)
7. Bulgarian Ministry of Education grants
8. Sofia Municipality community grants
9. Google.org impact grants
10. EEA/Norway Grants

### Phase 2: Validate Taxonomy
- [ ] Map all surveyed funders' eligibility to our taxonomy
- [ ] Identify gaps or overlaps
- [ ] Refine categories

### Phase 3: Legal Structure Research
- [ ] Document Bulgarian legal structures for non-profits
- [ ] Document registration requirements
- [ ] Identify equivalents in Romania, Albania, Serbia

## Key Questions

1. **Partnerships**: How to model "must apply in partnership"?
2. **Fiscal Sponsorship**: How to handle unregistered groups applying through registered NGO?
3. **Multi-Entity Organizations**: British Centre + NorthStar - one record or two?
4. **Legal Registration Verification**: Do we track registration numbers, documents?

---

**Document Status**: Draft - Awaiting Research
**Next Action**: Survey real funding sources for eligibility requirements
**Owner**: Kevin + Huw + Claude
